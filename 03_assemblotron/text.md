# In pursuit of the optimal transcriptome assembly

The goal of transcriptome assembly is to reproduce the sequences of all transcripts present in a sequenced sample. Although considerable progress towards this goal has been made, current methods fall far short of perfection. A typical transcriptome assembly program has many tunable parameters that control aspects of the algorithm. However, a single set of parameters is usually chosen to produce the assembly that is used for downstream analysis. Often the choice is made implicitly, by using the default settings of the software, rather than by systematically selecting the best values. Simply by ignoring the range of behaviours offered by the assembly tool, current practices exclude possible well-assembled transcript sequences from the results. More rarely, multiple assemblies are produced and merged together. It is notable that none of the de-novo transcriptome assembly merging pipelines to date account for the unique features of transcriptome data, so the merging process is error-prone.

In this chapter I will explore how a transcriptome assembly might be optimised and improved. The implicit assumptions of the current standard practice will be explored and tested. Motivated by these results, I will explain new methods for the automated optimisation of transcriptome assembly and their implementation in the `Assemblotron` software.

### Algorithm and workflow

![The assemblotron workflow: (a) Paired-end \rnaseq reads are input. (b) Reads are digitally normalised to a median coverage of 20. (c) Normalised reads are sampled in triplicate using one of several sampling algorithms. (d) Each sample is assembled initally using a range of parameter values for each assembler. The assemblies are scored with \transrate (e) One of several optimisation strategies is used to explore the parameter space for each assembler and identify high-scoring areas. (f) The high-scoring parameters are used to generate assemblies from the full normalised read set. (g) All assemblies from the full reads are merged to preserve the unique information in each.](figures/workflow.png)
