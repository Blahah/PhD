# In pursuit of the optimal transcriptome assembly (assemblotron)

![The assemblotron workflow: (a) Paired-end RNA-seq reads are input. (b) Reads are digitally normalised to a median coverage of 20. (c) Normalised reads are sampled in triplicate using one of several sampling algorithms. (d) Each sample is assembled initally using a range of parameter values for each assembler. (e) One of several optimisation strategies is used to explore the parameter space for each assembler and identify high-scoring areas. (f) The high-scoring parameters are used to generate assemblies from the full normalised read set. (g) All assemblies from the full reads are merged to preserve the unique information in each.](figures/workflow.png)
