# TODO for draft

- make workflow diagram
- [x] make plot of assembly quality varying with parameters on yeast data with soapdt (using full sweep)
  - done: ~/code/phd/figures/yeast_fulldata_soap_sweep_Kde.png
- mock or find numbers for assembly resources (full data, subset at 0.2, 0.1, 0.05 stream/graph)
- make a table/plot of the numbers
- diagram showing how stream sampling vs partition sampling works
- plot stream and graph sampling data
- add ability to use pre-generated results to assemblotron (i.e. make a new Biopsy target)
- run a load of tests of each optimisation algorithm using the added features
- plot the results of optimisation tests
