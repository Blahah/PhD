<p>C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis (hereafter C<sub>4</sub>) has evolved independently at least 66 times to solve the problem of the wasteful oxygenation reaction catalysed by RuBisCO <span class="citation">(R. F. Sage and Zhu <a href="#ref-sage2011">2011</a>)</span>. Despite accounting for only a small fraction of all plant species, C<sub>4</sub> plants contribute disproportionately to terrestrial carbon fixation <span class="citation">(Lloyd and Farquhar <a href="#ref-lloyd1994">1994</a>)</span>, dominate many tropical and subtropical habitats <span class="citation">(Cerling et al. <a href="#ref-cerling1997">1997</a>; Osborne and Beerling <a href="#ref-osborne2006">2006</a>)</span>, and have become even more widely successful through their overrepresentation in human agriculture <span class="citation">(R. Harold Brown <a href="#ref-brown1999">1999</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In the first part of this introductory chapter, C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis is placed in its physiological and evolutionary context. The humanitarian importance of understanding C<sub>4</sub> is explained, after which the current knowledge of the development and control of C<sub>4</sub> is reviewed and the further discoveries necessary to bring this knowledge to application are outlined.</p>
<p>The second part of the chapter explains the theoretical underpinnings and practical process of <i>de-novo</i> transcriptomics, an experimental approach being fruitfully harnessed in the pursuit of understanding C<sub>4</sub>. The principles and merits of this approach are discussed, before the potential insights and limitations are summarised.</p>
<p>The third and final part of this chapter reviews the various ways in which transcriptomics has been harnessed in C<sub>4</sub> research. The insights that have been gleaned are discussed, and the potential for further inference from existing data is highlighted. A roadmap for tool and resource development is proposed that would allow considerably more informative inference from existing data, and ultimately underpin progress towards the goal of understanding and engineering C<sub>4</sub>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> C<sub>4</sub> solves an ancient problem that affects almost all life on earth</h3>
<p>The light-independent reactions of photosynthesis are highly conserved <span class="citation">Kawashima and Wildman (<a href="#ref-kawashima1970">1970</a>)</span> and involve CO<sub>2</sub> being fixed with ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) by the enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (RuBisCO) to form two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (G3P). One of these G3P molecules re-enters the Calvin Benson cycle while the other is incorporated into a sucrose molecule (figure ). Sugars produced in this way are by far the largest primary energy source in the biosphere <span class="citation">(Fuchs <a href="#ref-fuchs2011">2011</a>)</span>; RuBisCO is thus the major conduit through which life on Earth is energised.</p>
<a name="fig:photorespiration"></a>

(<a href="#ref-peterhansel2010">2010</a>)</span></p>
</div>
<p>RuBisCO can also catalyse the reaction of molecular oxygen () with RuBP, forming one G3P and one 2-phosphoglycolate (2PG). While RuBisCO has a specificity for CO<sub>2</sub> over of ~80<span class="math inline">\times</span> <span class="citation">(Jordan and Ogren <a href="#ref-jordan1981">1981</a>)</span> oxygen is ~530<span class="math inline">\times</span> more adundant in the atmosphere, so that approximately a quarter of RuBisCO-catalysed reactions are oygenations <span class="citation">(Ehleringer et al. <a href="#ref-ehleringer1991">1991</a>)</span>. This oxygenation reaction is wasteful for several reasons. 2PG is an inhibitor of several enzymes linked to the Calvin cycle <span class="citation">(Anderson <a href="#ref-anderson1971">1971</a>; G. Kelly and Latzko <a href="#ref-kelly1976">1976</a>)</span> and must therefore be de-phosphorylated to produce glycolate. Glycolate decomposes rapidly to glyoxylate which inhibits activation of RuBisCO <span class="citation">(Chastain and Ogren <a href="#ref-chastain1989">1989</a>; Campbell and Ogren <a href="#ref-campbell1990">1990</a>)</span>. To avoid metabolic retardation, the the conversion of glyoxylate to the safe end-product glycine is required, which releases CO<sub>2</sub> (thus revoking the initial carbon fixation) and NH<sub>3</sub> (which is toxic). In order to recover a sugar product, glycine is converted in multiple steps to a single G3P, resulting in a total net cost of ~12.25 ATP for a single round of the entire photorespiratory pathway <span class="citation">(Peterhansel et al. <a href="#ref-peterhansel2010">2010</a>)</span>, and a net loss of CO<sub>2</sub>. As a result of this inefficiency, C<sub>4</sub> plants must produce abundant RuBisCO to achieve necessary rates of carbon fixation, leading to RuBisCO being probably the most abundant protein on earth <span class="citation">(Ellis <a href="#ref-ellis1979">1979</a>; Raven <a href="#ref-raven2013">2013</a>)</span>, and a considerable burden on net photosynthesis in most plants <span class="citation">(Sharkey <a href="#ref-sharkey1988">1988</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>By fixing CO<sub>2</sub> through  and a succession of 4-carbon molecules <span class="citation">(M. D. Hatch and Slack <a href="#ref-hatch1966">1966</a>)</span> in mesophyll (M) cells, and shuttling the resultant four-carbon molecule into bundle sheath (BS) cells with high RuBisCO content where CO<sub>2</sub> is released, C<sub>4</sub> plants are able to provide a CO<sub>2</sub>-rich environment for RuBisCO <span class="citation">(R. T. Furbank and Hatch <a href="#ref-furbank1987">1987</a>)</span>; see figure ). This reduces the oxygenase activity of RuBisCO and avoids wasteful photorespiration, resulting in greater total energy capture from photosynthesis.</p>

<img src="figures/c4biochem.png" alt="Figure 2. C4 photosynthesis compartmentalises the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis.

This greatly reduces the rate of photooxidation, in turn reducing the need for photorespiration and improving overall efficiency of carbon capture." />

<p>Because less RuBisCO is required in C<sub>4</sub> plants, they tend to have much higher nitrogen use efficiency <span class="citation">(R. H. Brown <a href="#ref-brown1978">1978</a>)</span>, and due to the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration mechanism a lower stomatal conductance is possible, resulting in greater water use efficiency <span class="citation">(BjÃ¶rkman et al. <a href="#ref-bjorkman1971">1971</a>; R. Harold Brown <a href="#ref-brown1999">1999</a>)</span>. These factors affect radiation use efficiency (RUE), and therefore total potential yield, which is on average around 50% greater in C<sub>4</sub> than C<sub>3</sub> plants <span class="citation">(Monteith <a href="#ref-monteith1978">1978</a>; P. Mitchell and Sheehy <a href="#ref-sheehy2008">2008</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis is typically associated with a suite of metabolic, anatomical and ultrastructural specialisations known as Kranz anatomy <span class="citation">(Dengler and Nelson <a href="#ref-dengler1999">1999</a>)</span>. These adaptations include: metabolic compartmentalisation, such that certain genes are expressed preferentially in either BS or M cells; increased density of BS cells within the leaf, such that each BS cell is usually surrounded by a single layer of M cells, with a concomitant increased density of leaf veins; presence of a suberin layer in BS cell walls to prevent CO<sub>2</sub> leakage (in NADP types); increased density of plasmodesmata linking BS and M cells to allow increased metabolite transport; and BS chloroplasts that are partitioned centrifugally (in most examples of NADP-ME subtype) or centripetally (in most examples of NAD-ME subtype).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> The profligate evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis</h3>
<p>Oxygenic photosynthesis using RuBisCO probably arose 2.9 billion years ago (Ga) and was abundant by 2.6Ga <span class="citation">(E. G. Nisbet et al. <a href="#ref-nisbet2007">2007</a>)</span>. This early atmosphere was rich in CO<sub>2</sub> and low in relative to modern levels <span class="citation">(Bekker et al. <a href="#ref-bekker2004">2004</a>; H. D. Holland <a href="#ref-holland2006">2006</a>)</span>, so RuBisCOâs oxygenation reaction was not a constraint for early photosynthetic organisms. Over the next two billion years, first cyanobacteria, then algae and land plants, gradually oxygenated the atmosphere from ~0.04atm 2.4Ga to ~0.2atm 0.5Ga, close to modern levels <span class="citation">(H. D. Holland <a href="#ref-holland2006">2006</a>)</span>. At the same time, CO<sub>2</sub> levels were depleted from ~2atm 4.5Ga to ~0.001atm 0.5Ga <span class="citation">(Kasting <a href="#ref-kasting1987">1987</a>)</span> due to cyanobacterial and algal photosyntheis. Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> then underwent two periods of sudden decline in the last 0.5Ga: firstly ~300Ma <span class="citation">(Berner <a href="#ref-berner1998">1998</a>)</span> due to the rise of land plants, and secondly ~30Ma in the Oligocene epoch <span class="citation">(Pagani et al. <a href="#ref-pagani2005">2005</a>; Beerling and Royer <a href="#ref-beerling2011">2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<!-- repeated evolution -->
<p>C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis arose for the first time during, and probably in response to, the Oligocene CO<sub>2</sub> minimum <span class="citation">(Vicentini et al. <a href="#ref-vicentini2008">2008</a>; Christin et al. <a href="#ref-christin2008">2008</a>)</span>, and did so multiple times independently in phylogenetically diverse lineages. The earliest origins occured in the Poales and Caryophyllales <span class="citation">(Christin et al. <a href="#ref-christin2011">2011</a>)</span>, which are now the most diverse C<sub>4</sub> clades, each containing at least 23 putative independent C<sub>4</sub> origins <span class="citation">(R. F. Sage and Zhu <a href="#ref-sage2011">2011</a>)</span>. In total, C<sub>4</sub> is found in at least 66 independent plant lineages whose common ancestors at C<sub>3</sub> and are thus thought to represent separate evolutionary origins <span class="citation">(Grass Phylogeny Working Group II <a href="#ref-grassphylogenyworkinggroupii2012">2012</a>; R. F. Sage, Christin, and Edwards <a href="#ref-sage2011-b">2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<!-- C4 uses components which already existed in C3 ancestors. They performed different functions, and have been co-opted -->
<p>The repeated evolution of C<sub>4</sub> may have been facilitated by the fact that the key components of the C<sub>4</sub> apparatus already existed in C<sub>3</sub> ancestors. The structures that became specialised for compartmentalisation of metabolism (BS and M cells), inter-cellular flux of metabolites (plasmodesmata) and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration maintenance (BS cell walls) were present ancestrally and needed only slight modification during development to serve their C<sub>4</sub> purpose <span class="citation">(Christin and Osborne <a href="#ref-christin2013">2013</a>)</span>. Similarly, no new enzymes needed to evolve for the pathway to operate; all were co-opted through duplication with neofunctionalisation from various roles in the ancestral C<sub>3</sub> species, particularly from general housekeeping roles <span class="citation">Monson (<a href="#ref-monson2003">2003</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">(Aubry, Brown, and Hibberd <a href="#ref-aubry2011">2011</a>)</span>. The key evolutionary innovations in C<sub>4</sub> involved modification of the expression patterns of the co-opted enzymes <span class="citation">(Hibberd and Covshoff <a href="#ref-hibberd2010">2010</a>; Williams <a href="#ref-williams2012">2012</a>)</span>, possibly driven by parallel evolution of regulatory transcription factors (Aubry et al., in prep.).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> The humanitarian case for crop engineering interventions</h2>
<p>Rice is the staple food for more people than any other crop, providing approximately 8% of the total calories consumed by humans globally (figure A) and around 20% of protein. The proportional contribution of rice to the human diet has been steadily increasing over the last 50 years (figure <a href="#fig:agriculturedata">3</a> A).</p>
<p>The global population passed the 7 billion mark in 2012 and continues to rise, projected to reach 9.3 billion by 2050 <span class="citation">(UNDESA <a href="#ref-undesa2010">2010</a>)</span>; figure B). Developing countries account for a disproportionately high share of population growth. To avoid increases in hunger and poverty, food production must rise to meet the needs of the increasing population, and in particular developing economies in Asia and Africa must be able to meet the demands of their populations. Contemporarily, poverty and hunger are widespread, thus further increases in productivity will be needed if current problems are to be addressed, in addition to preventing future ones.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/agriculturedata.png" alt="Figure 3. Global agricultural and consumption trends demonstrate the need for crop improvement intervention. A.) Area harvested for rice 1961-2010. Increases in area harvested for rice accounted for a large proportion of the increases in total rice production which helped meet the needs of growing populations from 1960 to the 1990s.

<p>Throughout and since the Green Revolution the rate of yield increase has remained steady. However, the proportional contribution of breeding to that increase has steadily declined, while the proportion of yield increase derived from increased fertilizer use has risen <span class="citation">(ZhongYu and YongChang <a href="#ref-zhongyu2000">2000</a>)</span>. This presents a major challenge to food production; increases from intensification of fertiliser are predicted to abate in the near future, and problems of sustainability threaten continued reliance on nutrient enrichment of soils.</p>
<p>The area of land under production of rice increased greatly from 1960-1990, and this increase contributed to the ability of the rice supply to keep up with the increase in demand. However, from 1990-2010 increases in area under production have fallen as the limits of arable land area are reached (figure <a href="#fig:agriculturedata">3</a> A). Thus in the future, unless new rice strains are developed which can enable more marginal lands to be brought under production, increases in area farmed will contribute negligibly to increases in rice production.</p>
<p>Taken together, these factors demonstrate a clear and urgent need for greater increases in rice yields, area under production, or both. Various technical solutions have been proposed, many of which include improving tolerance of rice to abiotic stresses such as drought, or involve incremental increases in yield. However, it is now increasingly recognised that the yield of modern rice strains is close to the theoretical maximum for the plant <span class="citation">(Evenson and Gollin <a href="#ref-evenson2003">2003</a>)</span>. Thus an intervention is needed that can raise the theoretical maximum yield. By introducing a different, more efficient photosynthetic system into rice, maximum yield capacity could be greatly increased at the same time as decreasing water and nitrogen requirements.</p>

<p>While these detailed analyses have so far been restricted to maize due to the extensive genomic resources available in that system, recent advances in high-throughput sequencing, <i>de-novo</i> assembly, expression quantification (see section ) and cell-specific RNA extraction (e.g. <span class="citation">Covshoff et al.

Such experiments have been recently completed in <em>Cleome</em> (Aubry et al, in press) and are currently underway in <em>Flaveria</em> (Kuempers, pers. comm.) and <em>Setaria</em> (John, pers. comm.). The repeated evolution of C<sub>4</sub> necessitates its study in a broad range of species, both to give insight into the evolution of the syndrome at the molecular level, and to discover whether the regulatory mechanisms underlying development and maintenance C<sub>4</sub> evolved in parallel.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Regulation in <em>cis</em> and <em>trans</em></h2>
<p>Control of genes recruited to C<sub>4</sub> can involve transcriptional and translational efficiency as well as post-transcriptional and post-translational degradation. These mechanisms can be targeted to promoters, coding regions or UTRs, and involve the evolution in both <em>cis</em> and <em>trans</em> factors.</p>
<p><em>Cis</em>-elements in promoters of some C<sub>4</sub> genes are required for cell specificity. It has been shown that 1.7kb and 0.6kb regions upstream of <em>PEPC</em> in maize are sufficient for M-specific accumulation <span class="citation">(Kausch et al. <a href="#ref-kausch2001">2001</a>)</span>, and that the cell specificity is not present in young leaves, suggesting developmental control. Additionally, a 41bp motif in the promoter of <em>PEPC</em> in C<sub>4</sub> <em>Flaveria spp.</em> with a G-&gt;A substitution and a CACT insertion <span class="citation">(Akyildiz et al. <a href="#ref-akyildiz2007">2007</a>)</span> has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for M-cell specificity <span class="citation">(Gowik et al. <a href="#ref-gowik2004">2004</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Nucleotide sequence in the coding region can generate cell-specific expression in C<sub>4</sub>. Accumulation of NAD-ME in <em>Cleome gynandra</em> BS cells requires a specific 240 nucleotide sequence to be present in the 5â region of the translated portion of the transcript <span class="citation">(Brown et al. <a href="#ref-brown2011">2011</a>)</span>. Frame shift mutation does not affect cell specificity, showing that nucleotide rather than amino acid sequence is important. The orthologous <em>AtNAD-ME</em> gene also accumulated in BS cells in <em>C. gynandra</em> and again a 240 nucleotide sequence was found to be necessary, suggesting the presence in <em>C. gynandra</em> of a <em>trans</em>-factor responsible for BS localisation.</p>
<p>Cell specificity in some C<sub>4</sub>-recruited genes also relies on UTR sequence. In a functionally redundant manner, either 3â or 5â UTRs of <span class="math inline">\beta</span>-carbonic anhydrase (<em>CA4</em>) and pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase (<em>PPDK</em>) are sufficient for M-specific localisation in <em>C. gynandra</em> <span class="citation">(M. Patel et al. <a href="#ref-patel2004">2004</a>; Kajala et al. <a href="#ref-kajala2011">2011</a>)</span>. UTRs of homologous genes from <em>A. thaliana</em> convey cell specificity when placed into <em>C. gynandra</em> <span class="citation">(Kajala et al. <a href="#ref-kajala2011">2011</a>)</span>. This again suggests <em>C. gynandra</em> has modifications in <em>trans</em> which are responsible for BS-cell specificity.</p>
<p>PEPC kinase (PEPCk), which phosphorylates PEPC in a light-dependent manner to regulate its activity <span class="citation">(Nimmo <a href="#ref-nimmo2003">2003</a>)</span>, is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin system in maize M cells <span class="citation">(Agetsuma et al. <a href="#ref-agetsuma2005">2005</a>)</span>. When the <em>ZmPEPC</em> gene is placed into rice the light-dark regulation is reversed <span class="citation">(Fukayama et al. <a href="#ref-fukayama2003">2003</a>)</span>. This post-translational control of expression must depend on the coding sequence, but it is not clear whether this mechanism controls cell-specificity.</p>
<p>Williams (2012, submitted) found that the promoter, introns and UTRs of <em>CA4</em> from <em>C. gynandra</em> act as enhancer elements. In Arabidopsis, expression of <em>pCgCA4::uidA</em> (with 1025bp promoter) was 2-fold greater than <em>pAtCA4::uidA</em> (with 2119bp promoter) when measured using MU assays <span class="citation">(Jefferson, Kavanagh, and Bevan <a href="#ref-jefferson1987">1987</a>)</span>, demonstrating the role of the <em>CgCA4</em> promoter region. The <em>CgCA4</em> coding sequence with intact introns showed ~5-fold greater expression than the cDNA coding sequence when fused with <em>uidA</em> and placed under control of the 35S promoter in Arabidopsis, showing that introns of <em>CgCA4</em> act as enhancers. Bioinformatic analysis showed that introns in <em>CgCA4</em> were shorter on average than those in <em>AtCA4</em>. GUS/MU analysis of CgCA4 and AtCA4 with either or both of 5â and 3â UTRs missing showed that <em>CgCA4</em> UTRs had additive enhancer activity. The 5â <em>AtCA4</em> also showed enhancer activity when an intron in the UTR was removed, while the 3â UTR repressed expression. These results demonstrate that CA4 has complex regulation of expression mediated by multiple elements in <em>cis</em> and <em>trans</em>.</p>
<p>Synthesising these results, it is clear that the regulation of C<sub>4</sub> has involved evolution of regulatory elements in both <em>cis</em> and <em>trans</em>. <em>cis</em>-elements in promoters, UTRs, coding sequences and introns can direct localisation and magnitude of expression, while <em>trans</em>-factors interacting with those <em>cis</em>-elements must have been recruited in C<sub>4</sub> evolution.</p>
<p>Clearly, access to complete sequences of C<sub>4</sub> genes, transcripts and proteins in multiple species, as well as their expression in different tissues and an understanding of their contextual regulatory networks, is desirable.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.6</span> The importance of wetland C<sub>4</sub> monocots</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Rain-fed paddy rice accounts for 90% of rice production <span class="citation">(Bouman et al. <a href="#ref-bouman2007">2007</a>)</span>, and a C<sub>4</sub> rice will therefore be a semi-aquatic C<sub>4</sub> plant. But previous and on-going comparative transcriptomic approaches have focused on either dicotyledons such as <em>Cleome</em> and <em>Flaveria</em> which are evolutionarily distant from cereals, or on C<sub>4</sub> monocots which grow in seasonally dry environments. It is therefore of importance, in the context of efforts to engineer C<sub>4</sub> rice, to understand how well C<sub>4</sub> might perform outside the hot and dry environment with which it is classically associated.</p>
<p>In fact, C<sub>4</sub> monocots in wetland environments are extremely productive. <em>Echinochloa polystachya</em>, a C<sub>4</sub> grass that grows semi-aquatically along the tropical Amazon floodplain, has been shown to be among the most productive plants in a natural setting <span class="citation">Piedade, Junk, and Long (<a href="#ref-piedade1991">1991</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Piedade, Long, and Junk (<a href="#ref-piedade1994">1994</a>)</span>], achieving rates of carbon fixation equivalent to maize under intensive cultivation <span class="citation">(Morison et al. <a href="#ref-morison2000">2000</a>)</span>. <em>Cyperus papyrus</em>, a wetland C<sub>4</sub> sedge growing in tropical African swamps, has been shown to have some of the highest rates of biomass accumulation of any plant in any habitat <span class="citation">(Jones <a href="#ref-jones1988">1988</a>; M. B. Jones and Muthuri <a href="#ref-jones1997">1997</a>; Jones and Humphries <a href="#ref-jones2002">2002</a>)</span>. These impressive yields have been attributed to the high nitrogen use efficiency of C<sub>4</sub> plants, allowing them to thrive in the oligotrophic conditions in standing swamp water, in combination with the generally higher RUE provided by bypassing photorespiration. It is therefore clear that C<sub>4</sub> can perform extremely productively in a hot, wet environment.</p>
<p>As rice is cultivated in both tropical and temperate regions, it is equally important to consider whether C<sub>4</sub> can still perform well in cooler wet environments. Supporting evidence comes from C<sub>4</sub> weeds in rice agriculture. <em>Echinochloa glabrescens</em> often outcompetes rice in paddy cultivation <span class="citation">(Rao and Moody <a href="#ref-rao1992">1992</a>)</span>, and has been shown to have a photosynthetic efficiency of 1.8<span class="math inline">\times</span> that of rice in field experiments <span class="citation">(Sheehy et al. <a href="#ref-sheehy2007">2007</a>)</span>, while completing its life cycle in 60% of the time <span class="citation">(R. F. Sage and Zhu <a href="#ref-sage2011">2011</a>)</span>. Thus there is precedent for fast-cropping, highly productive C<sub>4</sub> plants in the conditions used for rice production.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.7</span> Potential pitfalls of C<sub>4</sub> in the wet</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Knowing that C<sub>4</sub> can perform well in wetland conditions in certain species, a crucial question is whether the understanding of C<sub>4</sub> operation and regulation in current and emerging dry C<sub>4</sub> model species can be transferred to the wet environment. If it can, this provides a clear roadmap for transforming C<sub>4</sub> into rice. Conversely, if there are features that allow C<sub>4</sub> to be productive in the wet that are unique to wetland species, those features must be understood in order that the knowledge can be translated to a C<sub>4</sub> rice.</p>
<p>It seems likely that, given the unique physico-chemical conditions in semi-aquatic environments, there will be at least some such insights to be gained by studying wetland-adapted C<sub>4</sub> species. Exemplifying this, ammonium is the major nitrogen source in waterlogged soils and wetlands <span class="citation">(Watanabe <a href="#ref-watanabe1986">1986</a>)</span>, and requires special metabolic machinery to be of use in the plant <span class="citation">(Lam et al. <a href="#ref-lam1996">1996</a>)</span>. <span class="citation">Masumoto et al. (<a href="#ref-masumoto2010">2010</a>)</span> discovered that one isoform of PEPC in rice, <em>Osppc4</em>, is localised to the mesophyll chloroplast, and that this localisation is essential for successful nitrogen acquisition from ammonium. Previous attempts to overexpress C<sub>4</sub> enzymes in rice showed that, when PEPC and malic enzyme (ME) are expressed together in high concentrations, plants become stunted, possibly due to a futile metabolic cycling between the two <span class="citation">(Taniguchi et al. <a href="#ref-taniguchi2008">2008</a>; Miyao et al. <a href="#ref-miyao2011">2011</a>)</span>. However, in C<sub>4</sub> plants ME is chloroplast localised, suggesting that in combination with the chloroplast-specific <em>Osppc4</em>, a futile cycle could thwart attempts to place C<sub>4</sub> enzymes in the appropriate compartments in rice. This highlights the importance of understanding how C<sub>4</sub> operates in a wetland species to identify how the ammonium assimilation problem is solved, and whether there are other similar issues that need to be considered.</p>

These facts suggest that insights gained from studying the operation of C<sub>4</sub> in <em>E. glabrescens</em> will be directly translatable to engineering rice. In addition, a considerable literature exists on the species due to its interest as a pest of rice cultivation (e.g. <span class="citation">Janiya and Moody (<a href="#ref-janiya1984">1984</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">J.

<div id="de-novo-transcriptomics" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.9</span> <i>de-novo</i> transcriptomics</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The transcriptome of a tissue is the population of mRNAs present at a snapshot in time. <i>de-novo</i> transcriptomics involves assaying the transcriptome of a species which does not have a sequenced genome, and requires using only the evidence present in sequenced reads to reassemble the sequence of origin. In principle, <i>de-novo</i> transcriptomics promises massively parallel retrieval of the sequences of all transcripts present in a sample, along with highly sensitive estimates of the abundance of those transcripts. In practise however, the ability to do this is dependent on the interface between DNA sequencing technology, computational tools, and cost in both time and money.</p>
<p>Because <i>de-novo</i> transcriptomics offers the potential to obtain the sequences of many transcripts, it is by far the most cost-effective method for investigating multiple gene sequences in a novel species. And because expression quantification can be performed using the same data, systems-level approaches to reconstructing regulatory networks are made possible. In general, expression quantification with a high degree of accuracy, as measured by comparison to qPCR data, is possible using current methods. Accurate reconstruction of full-length transcripts for the purposes of nucleotide-sensitive phylogenetic analysis or motif discovery, however, is not yet mature.</p>
<p>Although the availability of computing power continues to increase rapidly, the capacity of sequencing technology is growing even faster. As a result, the running time of the algorithms used to perform simple overlap consensus assemblies such as the first draft of the human genome have become unworkable with modern high-throughput sequencing data <span class="citation">(L. D. Stein <a href="#ref-stein2010">2010</a>)</span>. Errors and uncertainties in the sequence data complicate the process and need to be addressed prior to assembly. Simple approaches to quality control of sequence data include trimming low-quality bases from reads and removing reads with an average quality below some threshold <span class="citation">(Schmieder and Edwards <a href="#ref-schmieder2011">2011</a>; Lohse et al. <a href="#ref-lohse2012">2012</a>)</span>. To further remove errors which are not identified by the quality scores produced by the sequencing machine, various models exist which attempt to learn the locations of errors by comparing reads to one another <span class="citation">(Le et al. <a href="#ref-le2013">2013</a>)</span>, or using graph-based metrics <span class="citation">(C. T. Brown et al. <a href="#ref-brown2012">2012</a>)</span>. To perfectly reassamble the sequences of transcripts <i>de-novo</i> using even error-corrected short reads is a challenge far beyond current computational capabilities <span class="citation">(Pop and Salzberg <a href="#ref-pop2008">2008</a>)</span>, necessitating the use of mathematical simplifications and computational shortcuts to approximate a solution <span class="citation">(Baker <a href="#ref-baker2012">2012</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The key algorithmic approaches to assembly from short read data draw heavily on graph theory, representing overlaps between reads as graphs with overlaps as nodes and the sequences themselves edges, and using graph traversal to trace the path of the original sequence. The de Bruijn graph <span class="citation">(Bruijn and Erdos <a href="#ref-debruijn1946">1946</a>; Idury and Waterman <a href="#ref-idury1995">1995</a>)</span>, in which reads are treated as collections of sub-words, is the most commmonly used data structure for this purpose (e.g. <span class="citation">P. A. Pevzner, Tang, and Waterman (<a href="#ref-pevzner2001">2001</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">D. R. Zerbino and Birney (<a href="#ref-zerbino2008">2008</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">J. T.

(<a href="#ref-grabherr2011">2011</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Schulz et al. (<a href="#ref-schulz2012">2012</a>)</span>). Recent theoretical improvements to this approach have been suggested. Using string graphs which do not use sub-words <span class="citation">(E. W. Myers <a href="#ref-myers2005">2005</a>; J. T. Simpson and Durbin <a href="#ref-simpson2010">2010</a>; J. T. Simpson and Durbin <a href="#ref-simpson2011">2011</a>; Gonnella and Kurtz <a href="#ref-gonnella2012">2012</a>)</span> or variations on paired de Bruijn graphs which retain read-pairing information <span class="citation">(Medvedev et al. <a href="#ref-medvedev2011">2011</a>; S. K. Pham et al. <a href="#ref-pham2012">2012</a>)</span> are examples, although implementations of these are in their infancy. The only graph traversal algorithms possible for any of these graphs involve the Eulerian Path, in which every edge is visited; solving the alternative Hamiltonian path, visiting every node, is an NP (nondeterministic polynomial time) complete problem <span class="citation">(P. A. Pevzner <a href="#ref-pevzner1989">1989</a>; Hoogeveen <a href="#ref-hoogeveen1991">1991</a>)</span>, meaning it is not computationally feasible for any significant size of input data. The precise approach differs between genome and transcriptome assembly, because in eukaryotes the transcriptome carries the additional complexity of resolving splice variants.</p>
<p>For all graph assembly methods, errors in read sequences lead to bubbles in the graph, with each error creating two transcripts where only one is real <span class="citation">(Baker <a href="#ref-baker2012">2012</a>)</span>. Additionally, repetitive sequences can lead to artifical loops which join fragments together <em>in silico</em> where so such connection exists <em>in vivo</em>, leading to chimeric transcript sequences <span class="citation">(Pop and Salzberg <a href="#ref-pop2008">2008</a>; A. Phillippy, Schatz, and Pop <a href="#ref-phillippy2008">2008</a>)</span>. Varying the parameters of the graph traversal algorithm can reduce the number of erroneous paths traced, for example by using longer substrings to calculate overlaps and only traversing paths supported by a certain number of connections <span class="citation">(Compeau, Pevzner, and Tesler <a href="#ref-compeau2011">2011</a>)</span>. However, this approach leads to greater fragmentation of the graph as some real corrections are ignored. Thus, all current assembly algorithms can either operate only on very small datasets, or introduce artefacts and errors during the assembly process.</p>
<p>Post-assembly, attempts can be made to remedy the problems introduced at the assembly stage. Current approaches to this problem use mutliple alignment based clustering <span class="citation">(W. Li and Godzik <a href="#ref-li2006">2006</a>; Edgar <a href="#ref-edgar2010">2010</a>)</span> to remove redundant contigs representing parts of the same transcript derived from bubbling of the graph. The problems of identifying and removing chimeric transcripts and sequences derived entirely from assembly artefacts are currently unsolved.</p>
<p>There are thus several stages of a <i>de-novo</i> assembly, with multiple programs at each stage, and each program can be configured in various ways. Pipeline development is hampered by the lack of specialised tools for assessing transcriptome assembly quality. While such tools have been developed for genome assembly <span class="citation">(Earl et al. <a href="#ref-earl2011">2011</a>; Gurevich et al. <a href="#ref-gurevich2013">2013</a>)</span>, the same metrics do not provide useful information about transcriptomes.</p>
<p>Assembly tools are non-trivial to operate, often requiring learning a novel interface and performing file-type conversions on the input and output. Moreover, determining the optimal pipeline to use is an open problem, largely because of the complexity of options. There are at least 10 possible programs to include at each of three stages in a pipeline, with at least 20 settings per program. Testing 4 values for each setting would mean testing <span class="math inline">(10\times20\times4)^3 = 512,000,000</span> possible pipelines. With the running time of assemblers varying from ~20min to &gt;6 hours in this study, clearly it is unfeasible to test all possible pipelines. For this reason, only the most rudimentary optimisation of assembly, in which a few parameters are varied for a single program, has been attempted in previous studies <span class="citation">(R. Chikhi and Medvedev <a href="#ref-chikhi2013">2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In summary, there are still significant challenges associated with obtaining highly accurate transcriptome assemblies. In order to address these problems, one research track in this study involves developing software to solve the problems of assessing transcriptome assembly quality, easily developing assembly pipelines, and optimising transcriptome assembly.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Background</h3>
<p>High-throughput sequencing of RNA has revolutionized our ability to assess the genetic basis of biological traits. For organisms that have sequenced and annotated genomes gene expression, splice-variants and mutations can be estimated from alignment of reads direct to the genome. In the absence of an appropriate reference genome, <em>de novo</em> transcriptome assembly is required.</p>
<p>Many <em>de-novo</em> assembly algorithms have been developed, including Trinity (Grabherr et al., 2011), Oases (Schulz et al., 2012), and SOAPdenovo-Trans (Xie et al., 2014), each of which takes a different approach to the problem. These tools provide multiple parameters and heuristics that can be modified to allow for variations in library construction, coverage depth and differences between organisms. The large parameter spaces mean that the same read data can generate substantially different assemblies both within and between assembly methods.</p>
<p>In addition to the considerable algorithmic flexibility, the data being assembled can be generated from multiple different RNA types. These can range from specifically amplified sub-populations of particular types of RNA, to total RNA encompassing all RNA types within the cell. Given the wide range of input data and assembly methods there is a need to be able to evaluate the quality of any <em>de novo</em> transcriptome in the absence of a known reference and identify the set of parameters, or assembly methods that best reconstruct the transcriptome from which the raw read data was generated. Moreover, there is a need to be able to identify within a given assembly the set of contigs that are well-assembled from those that are not, so that incorrect data do not influence downstream biological interpretation.</p>
<p>To date the majority of <em>de novo</em> transcriptome assessment methods have compared the assembled transcriptome to a known reference dataset (Lowe et al., 2014; OâNeil and Emrich, 2013). These comparative methods provide insight into the subset of known sequences that are represented within a <em>de novo</em> assembly but do not explicitly measure correctness of the assembled contigs. Furthermore, they only assess the subset of contigs that represent conserved sequences, so novel, divergent or non-coding transcripts are not assessed by these methods. Only a single reference-free transcriptome assembly evaluation tool has been published, RSEM-eval (Li et al., 2014). RSEM-eval provides an assembly likelihood given the read data, allowing the comparison of assemblies generated from the same input data. Although RSEM-eval quantifies the relative contribution that each contig makes to an overall assembly score, it is focused on assembly-level quality and does not provide descriptive statistics about the quality of each contig within an assembly.</p>
<p>We have developed <em>TransRate</em>, a method for evaluating the accuracy and completeness of <em>de novo</em> transcriptome assemblies that is focused on individual contigs. <em>TransRate</em> reports two key reference-free statistics: the contig score and the assembly score. The contig score measures accuracy and completeness of assembly for each individual contig by combining four independent components that are computed from the read evidence (Online Methods). These score components are designed to measure common assembly artefacts including hybrid assembly of gene families, transcript fusion (chimerism), spurious insertions, and structural abnormalities such as incompleteness, fragmentation and local mis-assembly (Figure 1). The assembly score measures accuracy and completeness of the whole assembly by combining the proportion of the read data captured with the individual contig scores. <em>TransRate</em> is free, open-source and available at <a href="http://hibberdlab.com/transrate" class="uri">http://hibberdlab.com/transrate</a>.</p>

<p>The aim of <em>de novo</em> transcriptome assembly is to accurately reconstruct the complete set of transcripts that are represented in the read data in the absence of a reference genome. There are several factors that negatively affect the accuracy of this process. These include error in the sequencing process, incomplete coverage of transcripts (due to insufficient sequencing depth), and real biological variability (such as variation in exon/intron retention, exon boundary usage, and nucleotide sequence between alleles). Errors can also originate from algorithmic simplifications such as representing the information contained in the reads as shorter words, and allowances such as allowing mis-matches that are used to reduce complexity of the assembly problem.</p>
<p><em>TransRate</em> proceeds by mapping the reads to the assembled contigs, assigning multi-mapping reads probabilistically to their contig of origin, analyzing the alignments, calculating contig level metrics, integrating these contig level metrics to provide a contig score, and then combining the completeness of the assembly with the score of each contig to produce an overall assembly score (Figure 2).</p>

For a detailed description of these metrics and how they are calculated see the <em>TransRate</em> contig score section.</p>
<p>To determine whether these four contig level metrics were independent, and thus captured different properties of each assembled contig, their performance was evaluated on a range of assemblies generated using different algorithms from multiple different species (Figure 3A). For each contig level metric the distributions of observed scores was broadly similar irrespective of species or assembly algorithm (Figure 3A). One notable exception to this observation is that the distribution of <span class="math inline">s(C_{\text{cov}})</span> observed for rice and mouse contigs generated using SOAPdenovo-Trans was markedly different to that observed for Oases and Trinity for the same species. This reveals that the contigs generated using SOAPdenovo-Trans on this rice data contained fewer regions that had zero coverage after read mapping.</p>

<p>Visual inspection of the global behavior of the contig level metrics suggested that the four scores could be classified into two groups based on the density function of the observed score values. Both <span class="math inline">s(C_{\text{ord}})</span> and <span class="math inline">s(C_{\text{seg}})</span> produced approximately uniform distributions spanning the entire score range (Figure 3A), whereas <span class="math inline">s(C_{\text{cov}})</span> and <span class="math inline">s(C_{\text{nuc}})</span> produced distributions whose density increased towards higher values (Figure 3A). To determine if these visually similar distributions were correlated, and thus measured features of the assembled contigs that were inter-dependent, we analysed the pairwise Spearmanâs rank correlation between the score components. This revealed that the metrics were poorly correlated (Figure 3B) and thus each provided independent assessment of the assembled contigs to which they were applied.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.3</span> Evaluation of the <em>TransRate</em> contig score</h3>
<p>As the contig-level metrics provided independent evaluation of assembled contigs, we sought to determine if the product of these metrics was informative of the accuracy of assembly. To assess this, 4 million read pairs were simulated from each of the four test species (rice, mouse, human, and yeast, see Independence of score components) and assembled using SOAPdenovo-Trans with default settings. Simulated reads were used here so that the true set of transcripts was known and hence the accuracy of the assembled contigs could be assessed. The resultant assemblies were subjected to <em>TransRate</em> assessment, and the utility of the <em>TransRate</em> contig scores was assessed by comparing them to a conventional measure of contig accuracy calculated by alignment of the assembled contigs to the transcripts used to simulate the reads (see Calculation of contig accuracy). Comparison of these measures revealed that there was a strong monotonic relationship between contig accuracy and <em>TransRate</em> contig score (Figure 4A). Across all simulated datasets, the <em>TransRate</em> contig score exhibited a Spearmanâs rank correlation with contig accuracy of Ï = 0.71 (Figure 4A, Supplemental file 1). For comparison we also applied RSEM-eval to the same dataset (Figure 4B). Here, the contig impact score from RSEM-eval, which measures the relative contribution of every contig to the assembly score, also showed a positive correlation with contig accuracy, however the Spearmanâs rank correlation with accuracy was lower than that observed for <em>TransRate</em> (Ï = 0.36, Supplemental file 1). Non-parametric correlation measures were used here to enable unbiased comparison of <em>TransRate</em> and RSEM-eval scores, as their score distributions differ in type, location, scale and shape.</p>

</div>
<p>Analysis of the interrelationship between contig scores and contig accuracy revealed that both assessment methods exhibited minimum value inflation (Figure 4A &amp; B). Though some of these minimum value contigs comprise accurately assembled transcript sequences, they are assigned minimum score values as they fail to acquire mapped reads during the read-mapping process. This occurs due to the presence of contigs within the assembly that better represent the true contig than the contig in question and thus preferentially obtain all of the mapped reads during the probabilistic read assignment stage. This phenomenon commonly occurs when the contig in question is a substring of longer contig in the assembly. As these contigs are redundant and they would be quantified as ânot expressedâ in downstream expression analyses of the assemblies, both <em>TransRate</em> and RSEM-eval are justified in the assignment of minimum value scores to these contigs.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.4</span> Application of <em>TransRate</em> for relative evaluation of <em>de novo</em> assemblies from the same read data</h3>
<p>Given that the <em>TransRate</em> contig score is strongly related to contig accuracy, we sought to develop an assembly-level score that summarised the information captured by assessment the individual contigs (Figure 4A). Here, the geometric mean of all contig scores was selected such that each contig contributed equally to the final assembly assessment. Analysis of the <em>TransRate</em> contig score distributions for assemblies generated using different assembly algorithms from different species revealed that most assemblers produced contigs that obtained a wide range of scores (Figure 5A). Some distributions also appeared to be multi-modal with overlapping populations of low and high scoring contigs (Figure 5A).</p>
<p>Comparison of the geometric mean of the contig scores revealed that on different datasets, different assemblers tended to produce more accurate assemblies (Figure 5A). On average, Oases produced the highest mean contig scores for mouse and rice, while Trinity produced the highest mean contig scores for human and yeast (Figure 5B). The percentage of the input that could be mapped to these assemblies ranged from 65-85% and thus significant amounts of read data failed to be assembled by each method (Figure 5C). To provide a single assembly assessment score that combined the proportion of read data contained within the assembly and the mean accuracy of the constituent contigs we took the product of the geometric mean contig score and the proportion of reads mapping to the assembly (Figure 5D). This assembly score places equal importance on the accuracy of the assembled contigs and the proportion of the input read data that is captured by the <em>de novo</em> assembly. In an ideal scenario where all of the input reads map back to the assembled contigs with no disagreement between the reads and the assembly the assembly score will be 1. Errors in the sequencing or assembly process that cause reads to be omitted form the assembly or reads to disagree with the assembled contigs will cause the assembly score to tend towards 0.</p>

<p>To demonstrate additional ways in which <em>TransRate</em> can be combined with BLAST based assessment of <em>de novo</em> transcriptome assemblies, the <em>de novo</em> assemblies was annotated using reciprocal best BLAST (bi-directional best BLAST hit) against the appropriate Ensembl reference dataset for that species.

No one method consistently outperformed the others, rather the different assemblers produced the best assembly for &gt;25% of transcripts (Figure 5E). Analysis of the total number of reference transcripts that were assembled by the different methods revealed that, though there was significant agreement between the methods, each method uniquely assembled a large number of bona fide transcripts not assembled by the other methods (Figure 5F). Taken together these analyses lend support to the idea that combining contigs from multiple assembly methods is an effective way to increase the completeness of a de novo assembled transcriptome.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.6</span> Filtration of contigs using <em>TransRate</em> contig scores</h3>
<p>As shown in Figure 4A, 4B &amp; 5A, many contigs within a given assembly can achieve low or minimum value scores and thus users may desire to remove them from the assembly. While <em>TransRate</em> allows the user to specify any contig score cut-off between 0 and 1 for filtration of assembled contigs, it also provides an alternative option whereby a specific contig score cut-off can be learned for any given assembly. To do this <em>TransRate</em> uses a global optimisation method to find the contig score cut-off value such that the <em>TransRate</em> assembly score function is maximised (Supplemental figure 1). This automated cut-off method is consistent with the problem definition and overall aim of <em>TransRate</em> (to assess the accuracy and completeness of a <em>de novo</em> assembled transcriptome using only the input reads) as it automatically selects the subset of contigs that maximises both accuracy and completeness.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.7</span> Comparative analysis of 155 published assemblies provides a reference for calibration and relative assessment of assembly quality</h3>
<p>To provide a reference distribution of <em>TransRate</em> assembly scores that end-users can use to assess the relative merit of their own assemblies, <em>TransRate</em> was applied to a set of 155 published <em>de novo</em> assembled transcriptomes (Supplemental File 3). All assembled transcriptomes were downloaded from the NCBI Transcriptome Shotgun Archive (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/tsa" class="uri">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/tsa</a>) and were chosen for analysis if they met the following criteria: 1) The assembly program was listed; 2) The reads were Illumina paired-end reads; 3) The published assembly contained at least 5,000 contigs. <em>TransRate</em> assembly scores for this set of published assemblies ranged tom 0.001 to 0.52 (Figure 6A, red line). Each assembly was also subject to automated assembly score optimisation producing optimised assembly scores that ranged from 0.001 to 0.6 (Figure 6A, teal line). Although some assembly scores showed little or no change following removal of low scoring transcripts, most improved when contigs below the learned cut-off were discarded (Figure 6B).</p>
<p>It has been suggested that the transcriptomes from certain groups of organisms may be more difficult to assemble than others (Martin and Wang, 2011). To investigate whether <em>TransRate</em> assembly scores varied for different taxa the results were analyzed according to their major phylogenetic groups (Figure 6C). For clades with more than 10 representative assemblies no association between assembly quality and taxonomic group was found (Figure 6C).</p>
<p>To determine if any assembler consistently produced higher <em>TransRate</em> assembly scores on end-user datasets, the performance of methods that had at least 10 assemblies was compared (Figure 6D). In this test Trinity, Oases, and SOAPdenovo-Trans all produced assemblies that spanned similar score ranges, with the highest mean score exhibited by Trinity (Figure 6D). In contrast, Newbler, Agalma and Trans-Abyss assemblies produced lower <em>TransRate</em> scores (Figure 6D). However, caution should be exercised when interpreting these results as the user-modifiable settings and post-assembly processing steps were not reported for these published assemblies. Thus the extent to which the <em>TransRate</em> assembly scores were influenced by changes in user-modifiable assembly parameters or post-assembly processing is unknown.</p>
<p>Given that neither assembly method nor taxonomic group produced a major effect on the <em>TransRate</em> score of an assembly we sought to determine whether the quality of the input read data was responsible for some of the variation in <em>TransRate</em> assembly scores. The read data for each assembly was analyzed using FastQC (Supplemental file 2) and the resulting read-level metrics compared to the <em>TransRate</em> assembly scores of the assemblies generated using those reads. This revealed that neither the read length nor the percentage GC of the read dataset exhibited any correlation with <em>TransRate</em> assembly score (Figure 6E &amp; F). However, significant associations were observed for both read quality (<em>r<sup>2</sup></em> = 0.27, Figure 6G) and the level of read-duplication in the dataset (<em>r<sup>2</sup></em> = 0.1, Figure 6H). In Illumina sequencing, low read qualities are predominantly caused by errors in the sequencing process, common sources include over-clustering of the flow cell and phasing. In contrast, increases in read-duplication is caused by errors in the sample preparation stage. It occurs during the PCR amplification stage of the read library preparation and is generally caused by either conducting the library preparation from too little starting material, or by having a large variance in the fragment size such that smaller fragments become over-represented during the limited cycle PCR. While there is little correlation between the number of sequenced reads and the <em>TransRate</em> score of the assembled transcriptome (Figure 6I) there is a clear association between the relative coverage implied by those reads and the <em>TransRate</em> score (<em>r<sup>2</sup></em> = 0.16, Figure 6J). In summary, the quality of the sequence reads, the number of reads per-gene and the quality of the input cDNA library (in order of relative contribution) explain 43% of the variance in <em>de novo</em> assembly quality. Thus, the quality of the input data is more important in determining the quality of a <em>de novo</em> assembly than the choice of assembly method that is used.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.8</span> Discussion</h3>
<p>Here we present <em>TransRate</em> a novel method for reference free assessment and filtering of <em>de novo</em> assembled transcriptomes. Our method is focused on a clear definition of an optimal <em>de novo</em> assembled transcriptome, that it should be a complete and accurate representation of the transcripts encompassed in the raw read data. <em>TransRate</em> avoids conflating assessment of <em>de novo</em> assembly quality with other criteria (such as coverage of expected reference transcript subsets) that are not equivalent to correct or complete assembly of the input reads. As the majority of published <em>de novo</em> assembled transcriptomes use Illumina paired-end sequencing, our analysis of the efficacy of <em>TransRate</em> is focused on this data type. However, the method is suitable for the analysis of other types of sequencing and thus is not restricted to use in the analysis of Illumina data.</p>
<p><em>TransRate</em> is specifically designed to provide detailed insight into the quality of any <em>de novo</em> assembled transcriptome and each of its constituent contigs such that comparative analysis between assembly methods and post-assembly filtering of good and bad contigs can be performed. As <em>TransRate</em> does not use reference datasets in the evaluation of assemblies it is equally suitable for the assessment of assemblies of all types of RNA, including long non-coding RNA, mRNA, ribosomal RNA and mixed RNA samples. Moreover, given multiple assemblies generated using the same input reads, <em>TransRate</em> can also be used to determine the assembly that best represents the input read data. Thus <em>TransRate</em> could be used to help improve the performance of multiple different <em>de novo</em> transcriptome assembly algorithms.</p>
<p>To help end users to interpret the <em>TransRate</em> scores that they obtain for their own assemblies and place them in context of previously published assemblies, we provide a meta-analysis of 155 published <em>de novo</em> assemblies. Here, a user generated <em>de novo</em> assembly with a <em>TransRate</em> score of 0.22 (optimised score of 0.35) would be better than 50% of published <em>de novo</em> assembled transcriptomes that have been deposited in the NCBI TSA. Through detailed analysis of these 155 published assemblies we reveal that the quality of the input read data is the major factor determining the quality of any <em>de novo</em> transcriptome assembly, explaining more of the variance in quality between assemblies than quantity of read data or assembly method that is used.</p>

If the mapped reads do not support the nucleotides of the contig then this likely because: A) The non-supportive reads should map to a different contig or a contig that is not represented in the assembly (a similar gene family variant, alternative allele, or other similarly encoded gene), or B) the assembled sequence is incorrect. In the case of the former, a missing contig (i.e.Â one that is not assembled) will negatively affect the score of the contig to which its reads incorrectly map. Though the contig to which they map may be correctly assembled, the negative score for this contig can be justified as the incorrectly mapped reads will render the abundance estimate of the assembled contig invalid. In the case of the latter, disagreement between the reads and the contig must be due to mis-assembly. To ensure that stochastic read errors that result in disagreement between a read and a contig do not affect the overall score for that contig support for an alternative nucleotide sequence needs to be provided by multiple reads, (see below).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The number of nucleotides in the contig will accurately represent the number in the true transcript</strong> <span class="math inline">s(C_{\text{cov}})</span>. This score measures the proportion of nucleotides in the contig that have zero coverage and thus have no supporting read data. If there are nucleotides in the contig that are not covered by any reads (regardless of the agreement between the reads and the sequence of the contig) then this should negatively impact on the contig score.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The order of the nucleotides in the contig will accurately represent the order in the true transcript</strong> <span class="math inline">s(C_{\text{ord}})</span>. This score measures the extent to which the order of the bases in contig are correct by analyzing the pairing information in the mapped reads. Here, if the orientation of the mapped reads does not conform to an expected mapping estimated from an analysis of a sub-sample of mapped read pairs then these incorrectly mapping reads will negatively affect the contig score. Similarly, if the contig could have been extended, i.e.Â there are read-pairs that map such that one read is present near a terminus of the contig and its pair is not mapped and would be expected to map beyond the scope of the contig, then such cases indicate that the contig does not use all of the available reads and thus is incompletely assembled.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The contig will represent a single transcript</strong> <span class="math inline">s(C_{\text{seg}})</span>. This score measures the probability that the coverage depth of the transcript is univariate, i.e.Â that it represents an assembly of a single transcript and not a hybrid/chimeric assembly of multiple transcripts expressed at different expression levels. Here the per-nucleotide coverage depth of the contig must be best modelled by a single Dirichlet distribution (described below). If the contig is better modelled by the product of two or more Dirichlet distributions then this indicates that two or more contigs with different transcript abundances have been erroneously assembled together.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The <em>TransRate</em> contig score is the product of the scores for each of these properties using the aligned reads as evidence. These four properties is evaluated as follows.</p>

<p>The alignment edit distance is used to quantify the extent to which the contig sequence is correct. The alignment edit distance is the number of changes that must be made to the sequence of a read in order for it to perfectly match the contig sequence. Here the edit distance of an aligned read <span class="math inline">r_{\text{ij}} \in R_{i}</span> is denoted as <span class="math inline">e_{r_{\text{ij}}}</span> and the set of reads that cover nucleotide <span class="math inline">k</span> (<span class="math inline">k \in \lbrack 1,n\rbrack</span>) as <span class="math inline">\text{Ï±k}</span>. The maximum possible edit distance for an alignment is limited by the read alignment algorithm (described in the Read alignment section above) and is denoted as <span class="math inline">\hat{e}</span>. The support for the contig provided by the reads is then evaluated as <span class="math inline">1 - \frac{e_{r_{\text{ij}}}}{\hat{e}}</span> for each <span class="math inline">r_{i} \in \varrho k</span>, and the mean of all support values is used to calculate <span class="math inline">s(C_{\text{nuc}})</span><strong>.</strong></p>

<h5><span class="header-section-number">2.1.9.1.5</span> Calculation of <span class="math inline">\mathbf{s(}\mathbf{C}_{\mathbf{\text{cov}}}\mathbf{)}</span></h5>
<p>This score is evaluated as the fraction of nucleotides in the contig that receive at least one mapped read irrespective of the agreement between the read and the contig.</p>

<h5><span class="header-section-number">2.1.9.1.6</span> Calculation of <span class="math inline">\mathbf{s(}\mathbf{C}_{\mathbf{\text{ord}}}\mathbf{)}</span></h5>
<p>The pairing information of the mapped reads is used to evaluate this score. To determine the parameters of the read library preparation a randomly selected sub-sample of 1% of all mapped read pairs are analyzed. From these alignments the orientation of the paired end reads is determined and the mean and standard deviation of the fragment size is inferred. All read pair alignments are then classified according to whether they are plausible given the estimated parameters of the library preparation and assuming that the assembled contig is correct. A read pair is considered correct if the following criteria are met: (a) both reads in the pair align to the same contig, (b) the relative orientation of the reads in the pair is consistent with the inferred library preparation parameters, (c) the relative position of the reads is consistent with the mean and standard deviation of the inferred fragment size. <span class="math inline">s(C_{\text{ord}})</span> is then evaluated as the proportion of all mapped read pairs that are correct.</p>
</div>

<h5><span class="header-section-number">2.1.9.1.7</span> Calculation of <span class="math inline">\mathbf{s(}\mathbf{C}_{\mathbf{\text{seg}}}\mathbf{)}</span></h5>
<p>The per-nucleotide read coverage data is used to evaluate this score. To evaluate the probability that the contig originates from a single transcript (i.e.Â it is not chimeric) a Bayesian segmentation analysis of the per-nucleotide coverage depth is performed. For a correctly assembled contig it is assumed that the distribution of per-nucleotide coverage values in that contig is best described by a single Dirichlet distribution. i.e.Â all nucleotides in the same transcript should have the same expression level and thus should be best modelled as a stochastic sample from a single distribution. In contrast, a contig that is a chimera derived from concatenation of two or more transcripts will have per-nucleotide coverage values that are best described by two or more different Dirichlet distributions. The probability that the distribution of per-nucleotide read coverage values comes from a single Dirichlet distribution is evaluated using a Bayesian segmentation algorithm previously developed for analysis of changes in nucleotide composition (Liu and Lawrence, 1999). To facilitate the use of this method, the per-nucleotide coverage along the contig is encoded as a sequence of symbols in an unordered alphabet by taking log<sub>2</sub> of the read depth rounded to the nearest integer. As the probability will be a value between 0 and 1, this probability is used directly as <span class="math inline">s(C_{\text{seg}})</span>.</p>

<div id="transrate-assembly-score" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.1.9.2</span> TransRate assembly score</h4>
<p>The aim of the <em>TransRate</em> assembly score is to provide insight into the accuracy and completeness of any given assembly. Thus the assembly score weights equally a summary statistic of the <em>TransRate</em> contig scores and the proportion of the input reads that are contained within this assembly. We note here that alternative methods for summarizing contig scores (such as weighting contig scores by their expression level) would produce different results. However, such schemes would not be consistent with the problem definition and aim of <em>TransRate</em>: to assess the accuracy and completeness of a <em>de novo</em> assembled transcriptome using only the input reads. This score assumes that an ideal assembly will contain a set of contigs that represent unique and complete transcripts to which all of the reads used to assemble those transcripts can be mapped. The <em>TransRate</em> assembly score (<em>T</em>) is evaluated as the geometric mean of the mean contig score and the proportion of read pairs that map to the assembly such that</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.1.9.3</span> Analysis of assemblies generated from real reads</h4>
<p>To demonstrate the utility <em>TransRate</em> contig and assembly scores using real data, <em>TransRate</em> was applied to publicly available benchmark assemblies from two previous analyses (Davidson and Oshlack, 2014; Xie et al., 2014). One set comprised different assemblies generated for rice (<em>Oryza sativa</em>) and mouse (<em>Mus musculus</em>) using the Oases, Trinity, and SOAPdenovo-Trans assemblers (Xie et al., 2014). The other set comprised assemblies for human (<em>Homo sapiens</em>) and yeast (<em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>) that had been assembled with Oases and Trinity (Davidson and Oshlack, 2014). These assemblies were chosen as they have previously been independently used in benchmark comparisons and each of the species has a completed annotated reference genome available. In all cases, <em>TransRate</em> was run with the published reads and the published assembly as input.</p>
</div>
<div id="independence-of-score-components" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.1.9.4</span> Independence of score components</h4>
<p>Correlation between the contig score components was measured for the assemblies from real data. To prevent larger assemblies from biasing the results, 5,000 contigs were sampled at random from each assembly. These contigs were used to calculate a Spearmanâs rank correlation coefficient using R version 3.1.1 (R Core Team, 2014). The correlation between any two score components was taken as the mean of the correlation across all datasets.</p>

<p>The full set of coding and non-coding transcripts for each species were downloaded from Ensembl Genomes version 25 (ftp://ftp.ensemblgenomes.org/pub/release-25/). Assembled contigs were then identified by BLAST searching the reference dataset for the corresponding species using bidirectional blastn local alignment with an e-value cutoff of 10<sup>-5</sup> (BLAST+ version 2.2.29 (Camacho et al., 2009)).

From the resulting fragments, 4 million pairs of 100bp reads were simulated using the default error profile included in flux-simulator. An assembly was generated from these simulated reads using SOAPdenovo-Trans with default parameters.</p>

<p>A survey of the range of assembly scores for published <em>de novo</em> transcriptome assemblies was conducted by analyzing a sub-set of transcriptome assemblies from the Transcriptome Shotgun Archive (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/tsa). <em>De novo</em> assembled transcriptomes were used in this analysis only if paired-end reads were provided, the assembler and species were named in the metadata, and the assembly contained at least 5,000 contigs (<em>TransRate</em> has no minimum or maximum contig requirements but a minimum number of 5,000 was imposed to ensure sufficient raw data was available for analysis). For each of these test datasets, the assembly and reads were downloaded. <em>TransRate</em> was run on all assemblies and FastQC version 2.3 (Andrews, 2010) was used to evaluate the quality of the read datasets.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> In pursuit of the optimal transcriptome assembly</h2>
<p>The goal of transcriptome assembly is to reproduce the sequences of all transcripts present in a sequenced sample. Although considerable progress towards this goal has been made, current methods fall far short of perfection. A typical transcriptome assembly program has many tunable parameters that control aspects of the algorithm. However, a single set of parameters is usually chosen to produce the assembly that is used for downstream analysis. Often the choice is made implicitly, by using the default settings of the software, rather than by systematically selecting the best values. Simply by ignoring the range of behaviours offered by the assembly tool, current practices exclude possible well-assembled transcript sequences from the results. More rarely, multiple assemblies are produced and merged together. It is notable that none of the de-novo transcriptome assembly merging pipelines to date account for the unique features of transcriptome data, so the merging process is error-prone.</p>
<p>In this chapter I will explore how a transcriptome assembly might be optimised and improved algorithmically. This will build on the work in the previous chapter that established a method for reference-free quality assessment of contigs and whole <em>de-novo</em> transcriptome assemblies. The implicit assumptions of current standard practice will be explored and tested. Motivated by these results, I will explain new methods for the automated optimisation of transcriptome assembly and their implementation in the <code>Assemblotron</code> software.</p>
